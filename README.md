# Welcome to Devtemplate v0.0.0

Template repository for CMake/C++ stack

This library is designed to do nothing. At the same time, it has a lot of features that many repositories are expected to have, including:
 - Build process automation
 - Installation and uninstallation
 - Graphical icons
 - Documentation
 - Python bindings
 - Packaging for different operating systems
 - etc.

How to use:
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Rename `devtemplate` in `CMakeLists.txt` into something else.
 3. Disable unneeded modules.
 4. Put your code in `source` and your header files in `include`. Change the list of files in `library.cmake` accordingly.
 5. Modify the CMake code if necessary.
